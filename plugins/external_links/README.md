# [Grav External Links Plugin][project]

> This plugin adds small icons to external and mailto links, informing users the link will take them to a new site or open their email client.

## About

`External Links` is a plugin for [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org) used to differentiate between internal and external links. It also includes the ability of adding "rel=nofollow" to links as and determines how external links shall be opened via the "target" attribute. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) is a well-known example.

Furthermore it enables you to specify multiple domains, each of them on a new line to prevent them from being seen as external sites.

## Installation and Updates

Installing or updating the `External Links` plugin can be done in one of two ways. Using the GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method or manual install or update method by downloading [this plugin](https://github.com/sommerregen/grav-plugin-external-links) and extracting all plugin files to

	/your/site/grav/user/plugins/external_links

For more informations, please check the [Installation and update guide](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Usage

The `External Links` plugin comes with some sensible default configuration, that are pretty self explanatory:

### Config Defaults

```
# Global plugin configurations

enabled: true                 # Set to false to disable this plugin completely
built_in_css: true            # Use built-in CSS of the plugin
weight: 0                     # Set the weight (order of execution)

# Default options for External Links configuration.

exclude:
  classes: [exclude]          # Exclude all links with this class
  domains:                    # A list of domains to be excluded e.g
  # - localhost/*             # (any RegExp can be used)
  # - img.domain.com/*

# Global and page specific configurations

process: true                 # Filter external links
no_follow: true               # Add rel="nofollow" to all external links
target: "_blank"              # Set target attribute of link

mode: "active"                # active = process and parse all links;
                              # passive = parse links, but don't set CSS classes
```

If you need to change any value, then the best process is to copy the [external_links.yaml](external_links.yaml) file into your `users/config/plugins/` folder (create it if it doesn't exist), and then modify there. This will override the default settings.

If you want to alter the settings for one or a few pages only, you can do so by adding page specific configurations into your page headers, e.g.

```
external_links:
  process: false
```

to switch off `External Links` plugin just for this page.

### Example

By default `External Links` adds a small icon to external or mailto links and opens by default links in a new tab. Any links in your Markdown file i.e. of the form

```
[External Link text](http://domain.com)

or

[External Link text](https://domain.com)
```

will then be recognized as an external link (an icon on the right is showing up), whereas

```
[My arcticle](my-article)
```

will not. You can exclude specific domains not to be seen as external either by adding them to the `exlcude.domains` option or by adding a class (default: `exclude`) to the desired links as in the following:

```
[Domain without external link icon](http://my-specific-domain.com) {.exclude}
```

> Please note that **Markdown Extra** should be enabled in your `user/config/systems.yaml` via `pages.markdown.extra: true` in order to add classes to these links.

Sometimes you maybe wish to explicitly set a link to be "external". Although this should happen in really rare cases, since `External links` plugin will automatically detect external links, it is possible. Provided that **Markdown Extra** is enabled, adding the class `external` to the link will do the trick:

```
[Always show external link icon](my-external-article) {.external}
```

### CSS Stylesheet Override

Something you might want to do is to override the look and feel of the external links, and with Grav it is super easy.

Copy the stylesheet [assets/css/external_links.css](assets/css/external_links.css) into the `css` folder of your custom theme, and add it to the list of CSS files.

```
/your/site/grav/user/themes/custom-theme/css/external_links.css
```

After that set the `built_in_css` option of the `External Links` plugin to `false`. That's it.

You can now edit, override and tweak it however you prefer. However, this plugin adds extra classes for styling to every link, you might wanna know:

- `external`, `external-link` -- Used to identify external links.
- `mailto` -- Used to identify mailto links.
- `no-image` -- Set if a link does not contain any image tags.
- `icon`-- Set if a link contains an image (with size <= 32px).
- `image` -- Set if a link contains an image (with size > 32px).
- `images` -- Set if a link contains more than one image.
